  "text": "Jens Christian Hauge\n\nJens Christian Hauge (15 May 1915 \u2013 30 October 2006), often written Jens Chr. Hauge, was a Norwegian who was leader within the World War II resistance\u2014and one of the two incumbent Milorg Council members in May 1945. He served as Minister of Defence from 1945-1952 and Minister of Justice from January to November 1955.\n\nAfter 1955 he never held political office, but \"continued to exert influence on political processes\u2014sometimes openly\", and sometimes less so.\n\nHe is also controversial, and has been criticised for not giving more information regarding central parts of the Milorg activities, such as assassinations of Norwegian collaborators.\n\nHe was born at Ljan, and he had an older sister Aase. Their mother was a school teacher of hand craft, and the father was son of a cotter. Jens Chr. Hauge's father was a former non-commissioned officer, who worked in an insurance company.\n\nHe was a conscript in Stavern in the summer of 1936, and served 48 days [of recruit training ] at the anti-aircraft regimental recruits' school (\"\"), In 1938 he received 15 days of recruit training.\nHe received training as crew on anti-aircraft weapon ('). In May 1939 he was summoned for the last 14 days of recruit training. He replied to the summons with a medical certificate regarding his varicose veins, adding that he was willing to be checked by military doctors, even though [his schedule] as a magistrate (') would make it difficult to leave work. He received a medical discharge, according to an annotation dated 10 August 1939, by Hauge.\n\nHe finished his final exams to become a lawyer, in autumn of 1937. He worked as a private lecturer (\"manudukt\u00f8r\") for law students, for the next year. In November 1938 he started as a \"dommerfullmektig\" in Krager\u00f8, to perform his period as a judicial \"conscript\". In January 1940 he again was working as a \"manudukt\u00f8r\" in Oslo. While still a law student he became a member of the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1936.\n\nThe military invasion of Norway, resulted in students not coming to his private lectures, so he was without income. On 12 April he applied for work at Oslo Politikammer, and started work the next day. In June, his employer had established \"Priskontoret\" (\"the price office\"), and he applied for a transfer, and became the leader of the office. On 13 August he was arrested for making statements (during private lectures\u2014of which he had resumed, besides his employment with the police) that violated (or were offensive to) Nasjonal Samling.\n\nWhile imprisoned, the \"Milk Strike\" occurred in Oslo, including the 10 September execution of two: the leader of a trade union and a lawyer in LO. \"[M]ore than anything, it was the justice-scorning executions of these two, that [later] led Hauge to Milorg.\" (Years earlier Hauge had the lawyer prosecute a case in Krager\u00f8; Hauge had barely known him.)\n\nDuring the last days of September, he was transferred to \"the newly established prison for political prisoners\", at Bredtveit Farm.\n\n17 October saw the trial of Hauge. (At the end of the trial, Hauge was granted a release until the next day.)\nThe verdict of 100 days in prison, whereof 66 days had already been served, was announced the next day\u2014and he was imprisoned. He was released on 30 October, after completing four-fifths of the sentence\u2014eighty days.\n\nHe joined Milorg at the beginning of 1942. (His wife and two children were relocated to Vestre Slidre in the middle of March\u2014to a [vacant] cotter home which belonged to Husaker (a mountain farm).)\n\nIn the middle of August 1942 he became inspector for (Milorg district) \u00d8stlandet\u2014replacing Knut M\u00f8yen.\n\nOn 3 October 1942 Operation Bittern landed four commandos in Norway. During the meeting where the leader of commandos showed his orders to Hauge, Hauge confiscated the accompanying list of 62 \"that SOE wanted to\" assassinate.\n(\"In 1941 - 1942 there was a tense relationship between Milorg and\" SOE.\n\"An early example of such a conflict, surfaced in the wake of the controversial Operation Bittern in the autumn of 1942\", according to Nj\u00f8lstad. SOE expeditions which followed, improved Milorg's relationship to the British: The Chaffinch-, Thrush- and Pheasant Expeditions.)\n\nOne evening between 7 and 14 October he met The Council (of Milorg) for the first time. The meeting resulted in a half-pascifistic message to the High Command, which in turn replied with a reprimand: To abstain from shooting in self-defense \"is in opposition to human nature\". (Hauge's dissent at the meeting was noticed also by a secretary at SL.)\n\nIn January 1943 he was promoted to \"Stor I\"\u2014the General Inspector of all Milorg combat groups in the nation.\n\nIn May 1943, he traveled to Sweden\u2014his first trip abroad for Milorg. (Nj\u00f8lstad says that Hauge's rapidly increasing influence in Milorg\u2014and later in \"den samlede hjemmefrontsledelsen\"\u2014was in part because he never feared traveling abroad. \nFurthermore, \"[M]any Resistance leaders were reluctant to such travel, because they feared that, in practice, it would mean the end of their effort in Norway. Or they calculated that their power to influence was greater when they communicated with \"utefronten\"\u2014from Norway, rather than meeting its representatives\" abroad.) 7\u20139 May saw one set of meetings, followed by Hauge's return to Milorg's Council, to be followed by another border crossing for meetings in Sweden's capital. The High Command wanted more operative control of Milorg's units, particularly in the districts. This is in part the reason for the establishment of radio links directly between Milorg's district commands and the High Command, without establishing radio links between Milorg districts; due to security concerns, the districts were only to communicate with each other through \"Sentralledelsen\" in Oslo.\n\nIn September 1943, he became a permanent member of the Sentralledelsen's top decision making group\u2014The Council (\"R\u00e5det\"). \"From then on, for all practical purposes, he was Milorg's top chief\", according to Nj\u00f8lstad.\n\nFrom October 1944, the contact with Frithjof Hammersen (officer in Wehrmacht), was handled by Ingrid Furuseth, Hauge, and Ole Arntzen. Evidence from Hammersen, was the first trustworthy evidence of cancelled plans for moving Hitler's inner circle members\u2014to Festung Norwegen.\n\nA 5 December 1944 directive (\"direktiv\") from SOE, stating \"that it must be a prioritized task, for Milorg and NORIC to obstruct German forces from leaving\" Norway. (It was Hauge's understanding that, there was a wish for severing the lines of transportation on land, so that the Germans were forced out to sea\u2014were the British were feeling increasingly stronger.)\n\nOn 16 December, the Germans attacked through the Ardennes Forest on the German-Belgian border.\n\nA 31 December failed aerial bombing attack on Gestapo headquarters in Oslo, had originally been requested by Hauge. (77 died, [around] 1000 became homeless, 23 buildings were hit\u2014whereof 6 were leveled. But Victoria terrasse was nearly undamaged.)\n\nKarl Marthinsen was assassinated on 8 February 1945. (Months earlier, Hauge was authorized by the government in exile, to have Marthinsen killed.)\n\nHauge and then General Inspector were arrested for traffic violations on 10 April, and released the next day.\n\nAfter Germany's capitulation, the fugitive chief of Gestapo in Norway was arrested on 31 May. Hauge met him, to have him report in writing about Fehmer's work in Norway\u2014with a 10-day deadline. (Hauge's official motive was to cut off Gestapo leaders' options of telling lies in court, about everything they knew about hjemmefronten, but did not use against them.)\n\nThe only award he chose to receive for his wartime service, was the one that was given to all Milorg's men and women: a silver needle.\n\nIn August 2008 signs were found of Hauge having been employed by Office of Strategic Services(OSS). His name was found in a directory of personnel files of employees from 1942 to 1945\u2014released by the US National Archives in 2008, according to Klassekampen. (Other Norwegians on the list were Wilhelm Hansteen, H\u00e5kon Kyllingmark and Knut Lier Hansen.)\n\nPaal Berg was asked by C.J. Hambro to form a government. Berg did not become a prime minister.\n\nIn 1945 Hauge was asked by Einar Gerhardsen if he would accept a position\u2014after Gerhardsen had formed his cabinet\u2014as a \"secretary and judicial advisor at the Office of the Prime Minister\". As \"Gerhardsen's secretary with responsibility for judicial cases\", he became linked to the legal purge of war-time collaborators and the trials against Vidkun Quisling and Knut Hamsun.\n\nAfter the war, he became a member of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 5 November 1945 he became Defence Minister\u2014the youngest of any [Norwegian] minister until then, 30 years old. (Previously, at the end of October, Andrew Thorne had approved the appointment, in the confidence of foreign minister Lie.)\n\nIn the spring of 1946 Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt (FFI) was put into service. (In 1945 he suggested measures for preventing Norwegian military scientists from remaining in British service, and in December the cabinet decided to establish FFI.) In December 1945 Otto Ruge resigned as general. In January 1946 Hauge fired then Chief of the Air Force, and the two agreed that the officer would resign at a later date.\n\nChief of Defence Halvor Hansson resigned in 1946.\n\nOn 14 May 1946 parliament decided to establish a brigade of 4000 soldiers to be stationed in West-Germany\u2014in line with the ministry's proposal\u2014Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. (In 1948 the cabinet decided that the brigade's soldiers were to be issued condoms. 400 000 signatures of protest were collected, and Hauge asked advice from Trygve Bratteli about the possibility of having Labour Party employees do partial checks of the lists, and \"Should it be done?\". (Municipal elections were scheduled for later in 1948, and Hauge thought that the signatures might harm the election campaign of the Labour Party.) The resulting advice was that the partial checks could be done, but that it was not advisable.\n\nThe autumn of 1946 saw the start of the Svalbard Crisis 1946\u20131947, involving the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 13 March 1947 he showed a document to then minister of justice, regarding Knut R\u00f8d\u2014who was preparing for trial in the appellate court. (The document was a five-day-old report (to Evang) about R\u00f8d's participation in a group that collected intelligence on communists and sympathizers; and about R\u00f8d having accepted Norwegian kroner 500 for locating the election lists for the Norwegian Communist Party\u2014pertaining to the last election of parliament and the municipal governments; and about R\u00f8d having recruited his brother, for the work [of the group]. (His brother was then a secretary in \"Kommunikasjonsdirektoratet\"\u2014a government agency.)\n\nOlav Nj\u00f8lstad says that \"Before the R\u00f8d Case continued, the Defence- and Justice Minister knew that the defendant was concerned about the communist threat and could become a useful man in the communist surveillance that they had started constructing - that is, under the condition that he would not be convicted of Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II, and fired from the police force.\"\n\nIn the middle of January 1948 he received a secret memo from Vilhelm Evang that stated that the Western military superpowers sensed an increased possibility for war with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn January 1948, \"Koordinasjonsutvalget\" (\"the coordination board\") was established, to coordinate and gather information from the intelligence services\u2014military and civil. Its creation is largely credited to Hauge.\n\nOn 25 February 1948, a coup in Czechoslovakia was completed, and it was followed by the \"Winter Crisis\". The same month the Soviet Union proposed to Finland a combined friendship and military pact.\n\nDuring the first days of March 1948 messages were received from the Foreign Ministry's stations abroad and embassies of Western nations, that Norway could be the next nation to be invaded by the Soviets.\n\nA front page of Norwegian daily Dagbladet insinuated that Hauge had never been a Norwegian soldier, because he in 1936 had been \"discarded by \"den milit\u00e6re legenemd\"\" (\"the military board of doctors\"). (He had served as a conscript before the war.)\n\nThe \"Winter Crisis\" resulted in a more encompassing\npolitical surveillance in Norway, in particular in the Armed Forces, and also within corporations and the civilian administration. On 13 March 1948 a meeting was held in the prime minister's residence, regarding \"what could be done to raise the level of preparedness against sabotage and coups within corporations and Norway's administration\". (The attendees were Arnfinn Vik, Haakon Lie, Rolf Gerhardsen, Tor Skj\u00f8nsberg and Hauge [and the prime minister].)\n\nOn 11 May 1948 Winston Churchill came to Norway (with Oslo \"on its head\") and was a guest at \"Slottsmiddag\". (A proposed visit in 1946 was cancelled, in the wake of the .) After the guests had been excused from the table, Churchill invited the prime minister over, for a conversation, and the prime minister asked Hauge to join. During the conversation, Churchill said that it was in Norway's interest to obtain a security guarantee from the United States. Furthermore, 'You ought not to follow Sweden. Sweden ought to follow Norway.' Furthermore, \"Norway interests the Americans because they think a lot about the defense of the Atlantic and about an Atlantic Treaty.\" (Hauge had conversations with Churchill the next day (at Det runde bords klubb\u2014\"the round table club\"), and at the farewell dinner held by Britain's ambassador\u2014on 14 May.)\n\nOn 17 June 1948 parliament started its deliberations about the Helset Case. Later in 1948 Olaf Helset resigned. (Nj\u00f8lstad says that the military and political opposition that were wishing to evict Hauge from his post as minister\u2014through the Helset Case\u2014ended up tethering him to the same.)\n\nThe Norwegian Base Declaration of 1 February 1949 was created after Soviet signalled that it would not passively watch that the Western Powers established forward bases in Norway.\n\nOn 4 April 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, and Norway became a (founding) member of NATO. (When early in January the same year, \"it became clear\" that Sweden would not accept Norwegian conditions for a defence union of Denmark, Sweden and Norway\u2014\u2014Hauge \"became a forceful \"p\u00e5driver\" (a person who pushes things ahead) for Norway's joining the Atlantic Treaty. - No one person [alone] can be credited\" for the joining. (Bergens Tidende has said that then Labour Party secretary and Hauge \"were decisive forces behind Norway's entry into NATO - against strong resistance within the Labour Party\".)\n\nOlav Nj\u00f8lstad says that points, about Hauge's contributions, deserving attention are: 1) \"Through his British and American connections he contributed in fetching, for the government, a realistic understanding of the conditions under which Norway would be able to receive \"krigsmateriell\" (\"war material\") and other help from the Western powers.\" Furthermore, \"this was a corrective to the wishful thinking\" ... \"in discussions with the Swedes, and in the discussions within the Labour Party\". 2) \"Hauge exerted great influence on the prime minister, who step by step reasoned and felt his way, to the standpoint which became Norway's choice.\" 3) \"[H]e was an effective spokesman (for membership in the A Treaty)\"\u2014to the rest of the cabinet, as well as the party's parliamentary group, and the party's leading \"organer\" (organs).\"\n\nDuring the first days of 1951, Labour Party \"opplysningssekret\u00e6rer\" (\"education secretaries\") had already become \"kommunistoverv\u00e5kere\" (\"overseers of communists\").\n\nAround 1950 leading Israeli politicians contacted Haakon Lie, wishing to discuss the possibility of Israel becoming a member of NATO. Lie sent them on to minister of defense Hauge, knowing that Hauge would reject the idea.\n\nGeneral Eisenhower's visit to Oslo in February 1951, according to Hauge, resulted in something that doubtfully otherwise could have occurred: minister Brofoss accepted the doubling of expenses for the Armed Forces.\n\nPlans for Stay-behind were made, and \"Rocambole\" was the section pertained to sabotage and commando operations. His policy about appointing Resistance leaders, in advance of a future military occupation, included: \"the total occupation must produce its own leaders\".\n\nAt the end of October 1952 Norway's second nuclear reactor (which later was shut down in 1967) was officially opened by dignitaries.\n\nOn 12\u201313 November 1951, then prime minister forced\n\nOn 5 January 1952 he resigned as minister of defense.\n\nAt Labour Party headquarters he held a position as information secretary. The party gave him extra work, and his income from the party surpassed the income he had as a minister. Nj\u00f8lstad says that after the first days, \"an enthusiastic and unusually productive cooperation arose within the triumvirate\"\u2014Gerhardsen, Haakon Lie and Hauge.\n\nIn 1954 his law office was established.\n\nHe became Minister of Justice in 1955.\n\nHe lied\u2014while addressing parliament\u2014\"about the eavesdropping (\"romavlytting\") of the Communist Party's national convention\".\n\nHe resigned as minister at the end of October the same year\u2014or 1 November.\n\nOn 6 February 1956 his candidacy for vice secretary general of NATO, was shot down by then secretary general. (Previously, French NATO diplomats had insisted that the next vice secretary general must speak French perfectly, which ruled out Hauge.)\n\nLaunching Hauge as a candidate, according to Nj\u00f8lstad, might have been motivated by a wish to keep Hauge from becoming Foreign Minister.\n\nHauge helped facilitate the sale of heavy water\u2014for use in plutonium production\u2014to the Israeli nuclear programme, while he was a board member at Noratom and judicial advisor at Institutt for atomenergi.\n\nOn 10 May 1958 Odd Dahl (the acting director of Noratom) wrote to the Foreign Ministry that the company had authored \"a draft for a contract regarding the construction and building of a 40 megawatt heavy water reactor for the production of plutonium\". Nj\u00f8lstad says, \"Then came the difficult point, that Dahl in no way tried to underplay: Israel wished to follow an independent national direction, regarding the field of atomic energy, and was therefore not set on accepting the strict stipulations of control (\"kontrollbestemmelsene\") that the US\" had on their export of heavy water. Furthermore, \"For this reason the Israelis preferred \"to buy water from Norway at a higher price than it can be bought from the United States\".\" Furthermore Dahl said that, the Israeli plans were unrealistic, but \"hardly unrealistic enough that they can be circumvented with plans of producing atombombs in the foreseeable future\". Furthermore, Dahl said that of course one could not rule out that the Israelis one day would want to go in that direction, but the help that Norway eventually might have given Israel to get started \"with legitimate civilian applications today, presumably can hardly be viewed in [a] relation to such remote possibilities\".\n\nOn 21 August 1958 Hauge suggested to charg\u00e9 d'affaires Miron that Israel might want to buy heavy water from Great Britain.\nMiron replied that if Noratom purchased the water back from Great Britain, and sold it to Israel\u2014with Norwegian stipulations of control\u2014then that would seem okay, in principle.\n\nNj\u00f8lstad says that \"State Secretary Engen became more and more convinced that the heavy water was to be used for producing nuclear weapons\", and in several memos he advised then foreign minister to not go through with the [proposed] agreement.\n\nOn 20 February 1959 the government authorized the deal, by royal decree (\"kongelig resolusjon\"). Noratom took possession of [20 tons of] heavy water in the first quarter of 1959\u2014from Britain's Atomic Authority\u2014and it was loaded onto a ship, that departed a British port. (Before being shipped out of Britain, Norwegian authorities \nsaw no need for an export license, since the shipment was outside of Norway's borders.) After sailing out of British jurisdiction, the ship was to be ordered to sail directly for Israel.\n\nOn 8 April 1961 Hauge was taken to the Negev Desert for a private meeting with then prime minister of Israel.\n\nOn 14 April 1961 Hauge conducted Norway's first and only inspection of the shipment of heavy water to Israel, as a result of US' impetus. (This was done at Rehovot.)\n\nHe [later] told the foreign ministry that he had not been to the Dimona facility\u2014thereby desinforming the ministry.\n\nOn 1 September 1971 Hauge\u2014vice chairman at Noratom-Norcontrol\u2014was informed that Noratom-Norcontrol [the same year] had purchased three tons of heavy water\u2014at the request of Norsk Hydro\u2014on behalf of Israel. Hauge demanded that the chairman be informed immediately, and that the chairman inform the foreign ministry that the sale had not been preceded by discussions by the board of directors. He resigned from the board of directors, in part because of how the leaders of Noratom and Norsk Hydro had handled the purchase.\n\nBy 30 September, the [1971] purchase of heavy water was cancelled.\n\nThe 1959 transaction was uncovered in 1979, by Sverre Lodgaard. Hauge told media that he had made a report to the government after the inspection, and that he declined further comment to the media.\n\nNine tons (of the original twenty, later augmented by one ton) were purchased back by the Norwegian government.\n\nFrequent correspondence between Hauge and founder of the Bilderberg Group (released after Hauge's death) showed that Hauge was a central figure on the board of the group. Olav Nj\u00f8lstad says that Hauge described attending the group's conferences as \"interesting, cheerful and comfortable\".\n\nHauge attended the 1955, 1956 and the 1957 conference at St. Simons Island, US. According to the official website of the group, he was a member of the steering committee.\n\nIn August 1961 then minister of transportation asked him to participate in a Scandinavian committee to deal with the economic crisis in the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).\n\nHauge was involved in the establishment of a state-owned oil company, which became Statoil.\n\nHe had contacted officials in the Finance Ministry about the possibility of having changes in law, to allow tax exemption \"when social considerations\" dictate. (In autumn of 1972, Jens Henrik Nordlie contacted Hauge about converting a corporation (Kioskkompaniet) into a foundation.) In 1973 the financing of Fritt Ord (a foundation) became a reality, and the foundation was established in 1974.\n\nThe September 1987 death of Einar Gerhardsen, according to Nj\u00f8lstad, \"marked the beginning of the end of Hauge's political influence within the Labour Party\". (Before that, Gerhardsen wrote a letter of reconciliation to Haakon Lie, dated 15 April 1985; Hauge authored its redemptive wording: \"For a long time, I [Gerhardsen] have been aware of, that I back then should not have \"tatt ordet\" (\"taken the word\") and said what I said.\". (In 1967 at the national convention, according to Hauge, Gerhardsen \"broke the staff over Haakon Lie\".)\n\nOn 27 September 1994 two publishers called in a press conference, with the authors of two books about Resistance fighter Kai Holst.\nIn 2008 Olav Nj\u00f8lstad said that Tore Pryser and Espen Haavardsholm during the launch of the books, the two went \"very far in accusing Hauge of sitting on important information about Holst's death\".\n\nHauge has been in question in relation to the strange circumstances regarding the death of the Milorg member Kai Holst in Stockholm just after the war.\n\nIn January 1997 he refused to testify in an open hearing of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee, regarding the conclusions of the Lund Commission. (Previously Ronald Bye had told the committee that would not testify, if Haakon Lie and Hauge did not.)\n\nHauge also became a monumental figure in the Norwegian war industry. He became board member of several state-owned companies, especially within nuclear power and defence systems, including member of board of directors of Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk, and chairman of Statoil 1972\u201375.\n\nIn Scandinavian Airlines System he was a board member for more than 20 years.\n\nNorway's Resistance Museum received from him documents that he had about his work in Milorg. Later he agreed with Professor Olav Riste\u2014employed at Institute for Defence Studies\u2014that the institute would receive documents about his work as minister of defense. In 2003 Riksarkivet and he agreed about the establishment of \"Jens Chr. Hauges Privatarkiv\", which resulted in more than 60 or 65 \"hyllemeter\" (\"meters of shelf\") of documents.\n\n\"The greatest treasures, were the last that he relinquished. Some where first found\", according to Nj\u00f8lstad, when Hauge's two youngest sons and Nj\u00f8lstad, went thru the residence at \"Bj\u00f8rnveien\" [at Slemdal ], autumn of 2005\u2014before it was put up for sale.\n\nDuring 2004 and most of 2005 he regularly met with biographer Olav Nj\u00f8lstad and the main consultant of the book project, Olav Riste.\n\nThe book's other consultants were Arnfinn Moland, Even Lange and Helge \u00d8. Pharo.\n\nOn 30 October 2006 he died at a retirement home in Vinderen, Oslo.\n\nOn 7 November a service was held at Ris Church, \"p\u00e5 statens bekostning\". Attendees included then king of Norway, prime minister, leader of LO, mayor of Oslo and other politicians; Haakon Lie, Gunnar S\u00f8nsteby, Knut Haugland.\n\nSome weeks later his ashes were interred.\n\nMedia commented his death: The Times said Hauge's willpower and resolve\u2014including to implement unorthodox ideas, with authoritarian means\u2014was doomed to make him [into] a controversial figure in a society \"that normally adorns itself with being egalitarian and unanimous\".\n\nHauge was survived by six children.\n\nHis father died in 1940.\nHis mother died in 1957. His second wife Liv Grannes died 30 November 2004. His ex-wife Lillann died on 2 March 2005.\n\nHe married Anne Sophie \"Lillann\" Dedekam in 1938.\nFrank Rossavik has referred to \"Hauge's many women in and outside marriage, and his betrayal to his own family\".\n\nDuring World War II he had cover names: Tor Aas was his identity at his cover apartment at Colbj\u00f8rnsens Street 8.\n\nOn 10 April 2012 NRK broadcast a documentary about Hauge \u2014\"Nasjonens skygge\" (\"the nation's shadow\"), part one of two.",

  "title": "Adenomyosis",
  "text": "Adenomyosis\n\nAdenomyosis is a medical condition characterized by the growth of cells that build up the inside of the uterus (endometrium) atypically located within the cells that put up the uterine wall (myometrium), as a result, thickening of the uterus occurs. As well as being misplaced in patients with this condition, endometrial tissue is completely functional. The tissue thickens, sheds and bleeds during every menstrual cycle.\n\nAdenomyosis can be found together with endometriosis, but patients with endometriosis present endometrial tissue abnormally located entirely outside the uterus. The two conditions are found together in many cases yet often occur separately. Before being recognized as a distinct condition, adenomyosis was called \"endometriosis interna\". The less-commonly-used term \"adenomyometritis\" is a more specific name for the condition, specifying involvement of the uterus.\n\nThe condition is typically found in women between the ages of 35 and 50, but also affects younger women. Patients with adenomyosis often present with painful menses (dysmenorrhea), profuse menses (menorrhagia), or both. Other possible symptoms are pain during sexual intercourse, chronic pelvic pain and irritation of the urinary bladder. \n\nIn adenomyosis, \"basal\" endometrium penetrates into hyperplastic myometrial fibers. Therefore, unlike functional layer, basal layer does not undergo typical cyclic changes with menstrual cycle.\n\nAdenomyosis may involve the uterus focally, creating an adenomyoma. With diffuse involvement, the uterus becomes bulky and heavier.\n\nAdenomyosis can vary widely in the type and severity of symptoms that it causes, ranging from being entirely asymptomatic 33% of the time to being a severe and debilitating condition in some cases. Women with adenomyosis typically first report symptoms when they are between 40 and 50, but symptoms can occur in younger women.\n\nSymptoms and the estimated percent affected may include:\nClinical signs of adenomyosis may include: \nWomen with adenomyosis are also more likely to have other uterine conditions, including:\n\nThe cause of adenomyosis is unknown, although it has been associated with any sort of uterine trauma that may break the barrier between the endometrium and myometrium, known as the junctional zone, such as a caesarean section, surgical pregnancy termination, and any pregnancy. It can be linked with endometriosis, but studies looking into similarities and differences between these two conditions have conflicting results.\n\nThe pathogenesis of adenomyosis still remains unclear, but the functioning of the inner myometrium, also called the junction zone (JZ), is believed to play a major role in the development of adenomyosis. It is also a matter of discussion whether the link between reproductive disorders and major obstetrical disorders also lies here. Parity, age, and previous uterine abrasion increase the risk of adenomyosis. Hormonal factors such as local hyperestrogenism and elevated levels of s-prolactin as well as autoimmune factors have also been identified as possible risk factors. As both the myometrium and stroma in an adenomyosis affected uterus show significant differences from those of a non-affected uterus, a complex origin that includes multifactorial changes on both genetic and biochemical levels is likely.\n\nThe tissue injury and repair (TIAR) theory is now widely accepted and suggests that uterine hyperperistalsis (i.e., increased peristalsis), during early periods of reproductive life will induce micro-injury at the endometrial-myometrial interface (EMI) region. That again leads to elevation of local estrogen in order to heal the damage. At the same time, estrogen treatment will increase uterine peristalsis again, leading to a vicious circle and a chain of biological alterations essential for the development of adenomyosis. Iatrogenic injury of the junctional zone or physiological damages due to placental implantation most likely results in the same pathological cascade. This also explains that adenomyosis often gets more severe after each pregnancy and childbirth, while endometriosis will ameliorate. \n\nMisplaced endometrial tissue proliferation in the myometrium causes symptoms through different mechanisms.\nUterine menstrual contractions are caused by prostaglandin, which is produced by normal endometrial tissue. Dysmenorrhea is the main characteristic for this disease which are the result for high prostaglandin levels. Endometrial proliferation is also led by estrogen; some treatments try to reduce its levels in order to decrease symptoms.\nAdenomyosis patients present with heavy menstrual bleeding due to the increase of endometrial tissue, greater degree of vascularization, atypical uterine contractions and increased levels of prostaglandins, estrogen and eicosanoids.\n\nThe diagnosis of adenomyosis is through a pathologist microscopically examining small tissue samples of the uterus. These tissue samples can come from a uterine biopsy or directly following a hysterectomy. Uterine biopsies can be obtained by either a laparoscopic procedure through the abdomen or hysteroscopy through the vagina and cervix.\n\nThe diagnosis is established when the pathologist finds invading clusters of endometrial tissue within the myometrium. Several diagnostic criterion can be used, but typically they require either the endometrial tissue to have invaded greater than 2% of the myometrium, or a minimum invasion depth between 2.5 to 8mm.\n\nGross Findings:\nMicroscopic Findings:\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\nAdenomyosis can vary widely in the extent and location of its invasion within the uterus. As a result, there are no established pathognomonic features to allow for a definitive diagnosis of adenomyosis through non-invasive imaging. Nevertheless, non-invasive imaging techniques such as transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can both be used to strongly suggest the diagnosis of adenomyosis, guide treatment options, and monitor response to treatment. Indeed, TVUS and MRI are the only two practical means available to establish a pre-surgical diagnosis.\n\nTransvaginal ultrasonography is a cheap and readily available imaging test that is typically used early during the evaluation of gynecologic symptoms. Ultrasound imaging, like MRI, does not use radiation and is safe for examination of the pelvis and female reproductive organs. Overall, it is estimated that transvaginal ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 85% for the detection of adenomyosis.\n\nCommon transvaginal ultrasound findings in patients with adenomyosis include the following:\nLess common findings:\n\nThe power Doppler or Doppler ultrasonography function can be used during transvaginal ultrasonography to help differentiate adenomyomas from uterine fibroids. This is because uterine fibroids typically have blood vessels circling the fibroid's capsule. In contrast, adenomyomas are characterized by widespread blood vessels within the lesion. Doppler ultrasonography also serves to differentiate the static fluid within myometrial cysts from flowing blood within vessels.\n\nThe junction zone (JZ), or a small distinct hormone-dependent region at the endometrial-myometrial interface, may be assessed by three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3D TVUS) and MRI. Features of adenomyosis are disruption, thickening, enlargement or invasion of the junctional zone.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides slightly better diagnostic capability compared to TVUS, due to the increased ability of MRI to differentiate objectively between different types of soft tissue. This is possible with MRI's higher spatial and contrast resolution. Overall, it is estimated that MRI has a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 91% for the detection of adenomyosis. Diagnosis through MRI focuses predominately upon investigating the junctional zone. The uterus will have a thickened junctional zone with darker\/diminished signal on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.\n\nThree objective measures of the junctional zone can be used to diagnose adenomyosis.\nInterspersed within the thickened, darker signal of the junctional zone, one will often see foci of hyperintensity (bright spots) on the T2 weighted scans representing small cystically dilatated glands or more acute sites of microhemorrhage.\n\nMRI is limited by other factors, but not by calcified uterine fibroids (as is ultrasound). In particular, MRI is better able to differentiate adenomyosis from multiple small uterine fibroids.\n\nAdenomyosis can only be cured definitively with surgical removal of the uterus. As adenomyosis is responsive to reproductive hormones, it reasonably abates following menopause when these hormones decrease. For women in their reproductive years, adenomyosis can typically be managed with the goals to provide pain relief, to restrict progression of the process, and to reduce significant menstrual bleeding.\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, surgical management of adenomyosis is split into two categories: uterine-sparing and non-uterine-sparing procedures. Uterine-sparing procedures are surgical operations that do not include surgical removal of the uterus. Some uterine-sparing procedures have the benefit of improving fertility or retaining the ability to carry a pregnancy to term. In contrast, some uterine-sparing procedures worsen fertility or even result in complete sterility. The impact of each procedure on a woman's fertility is of particular concern and typically guides the selection. Non-uterine-sparing procedures, by definition, include surgical removal of the uterus and consequently they will all result in complete sterility.\n\n\n\nHysterectomy, or surgical removal of the uterus, has historically been the primary method of diagnosing and treating adenomyosis. It was especially popular in women who had completed their childbearing or in cases where fertility was not desired. Today, there are many more medical and surgical interventions available. These treatments, such as hormonal therapy and endometrial ablation, have significantly reduced the number of women who require a hysterectomy. That being said, hysterectomies remain as the final treatment option for women in whom the other treatments have failed. Typically viewed as definitive treatment for the bleeding and pelvic pain associated with adenomyosis, a hysterectomy will always result in sterility and cessation of menstrual bleeding. Pelvic pain, on the other hand, can persist after a hysterectomy in as many as 22% of women.\n\nThere are many different types of hysterectomy, with varying options existing to removal the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and cervix. Also, the varying types of hysterectomy can be performed by many different surgical techniques.\n\nA hysterectomy can be performed: \nVariants also exist which combine several of these techniques and surgeries can even change during the operation from one technique to another in response to unforeseen obstacles or individual anatomy considerations. For example, adenomyosis can increase the size of the uterus to such an extent that it physically cannot be removed through the vagina without first being cut into smaller pieces.\n\nRecent data suggest a prevalence of 20 to 35%.\n\nAdenomyosis is an often progressing condition. It is advocated that adenomyosis poses no increased risk for cancer development. However, both entities could coexist and the endometrial tissue within the myometrium could harbor endometrioid adenocarcinoma, with potentially deep myometrial invasion. As the condition is estrogen-dependent, menopause presents a natural cure. Ultrasound features of adenomyosis will still be present after menopause. People with adenomyosis are also more likely to have uterine fibroids or endometriosis.\n\nAdenomyosis itself can cause infertility issues, however, fertility can be improved if the adenomyosis has resolved following hormone therapies like levonorgestrel therapy. The discontinuation of medication or removal of IUD can be timed to be coordinated with fertility treatments. There has also been one report of a successful pregnancy and healthy birth following high-frequency ultrasound ablation of adenomyosis. \n\nPreterm labour and premature rupture of membranes both occur more frequently in women with adenomyosis.\n\nIn sub-fertile women who received in-vitro fertilization (IVF), women with adenomyosis were less likely to become pregnant and subsequently more likely to experience a miscarriage. Given this, it is encouraged to screen women for adenomyosis by TVUS or MRI before starting assisted reproduction treatments (ART).\n\nThe term \"adenomyosis\" is derived from the Greek terms \"adeno-\" (meaning \"gland\"), \"myo-\" (meaning \"muscle\"), and \"-osis\" (meaning \"condition\").

  "title": "Hazyview",
  "text": "Hazyview\n\nHazyview is a sub-tropical farming town in Mpumalanga, South Africa, renowned for its large banana and macadamia nut industries, contributing about 20% of South Africa's bananas and 30% of macadamia output. Bordering the Kruger National Park, the town's name is derived from the shimmering haze that occurs during the heat of summer. Most of the province of Mpumalanga's private game reserves are found just east of Hazyview.\n\nThis is one of the ancient Mapulana kingdoms under Kgoshi Magashula. Magashula used to command authority in the area before colonisation. It was he (Magashula) who gave Joao Albasini and thousands of his Tsonga followers permission to settle in the area in 1840 in what is known today as Numbi gate and PretoriusKop. For the land at Numbi on the banks of the Sabie River, Albasini gave kgoshi Magashula 200 herd of cattle as a purchase price for the land for chief Manungu his friend, this was after Kgoshi Magashula was satisfied that Albasini and his Tsonga people were settling on his land with good intentions, that is, to join him in fighting off invading Swazi impis. Joao Albasini, a warmonger and a master of modern warfare, used his Tsonga followers to prevent Swazis from conquering Magashula's land, pleasing Kgoshi Magushula and reassuring him that the Swazis had met their match. Albasini and his Tsonga followers planted wheat on the banks of the Sabie river and established a bakery where fine white bread was produced, which made Magashule's kraal famous in the entire lowveld.\n\nAlbasini's Tsonga settlement in the lowveld was known collectively as Magashula's kraal. While at Magashula's kraal, Albasini's homesteads was based in what is known today as Numbi gate and his Tsonga followers defended his home against invading Swazi impis. The remains of Albasini's home can still be seen today at Numbi gate and is known as 'Albasini Ruins'.\n\nKgoshi Magashula gave the Tsonga people land to settle at Numbi gate and Pretoriuskop with strict rules, that is, the Tsonga people had to help him to expel and defeat the invading Swazis sent by King Mswati. As the Tsonga settlements spread from Pretoriuskop, Skukuza, Numbi, and other areas east of the current town of Hazyview, the Swazis' plan of conquering Magashula's land failed, because the Tsonga people prevented them from carrying out their military expedition. One such important figure that taught Swazis a lesson was a Tsonga chief known as Manungu, Manungu was a general in Joao Albasini's army and was placed in Pretoriuskop as an Induna. Pretoriuskop was a highly populated area by Tsonga people whose job, as agreed with kgoshi Magashule, was to block the Swazis from entering Magashula's land, Manungu was successful as an induna in safeguarding the land against Swazi invaders. When the Voortrekker leader Pretorius died at Josekhulu, it was Joao Albasini and his followers who conducted the funeral and buried him next to a hill and named the place Pretoriuskop in honour of this brave Voortrekker leader.\n\nWith the help of Joao Albasini and thousands of his Tsonga followers, the Swazi's invading tactics were dealt a great blow, the Tsonga's sprawling settlement, starting from Pretoriuskop managed to push back the invading Swazing back to where they came from. With Mission accomplished and the Swazi impis pushed backed by Albasini and his Tsonga followers, Albasini left Magashula's kraal in 1843 for Luonde ( in Venda) and became a powerful Warlord there, he established a powerful army of 2000 armed Tsonga men whom he used to harass the Venda and their chiefs. As a Warlord in Luonde, Albasini became a white chief of his Tsonga people in the entire area where Tsonga people live and brought in extra thousands of Tsonga settlers from southern Mozambique to take up vast tracts of land starting from Elim Hospital down the escarpment, he also appointed all Tsonga chiefs in the Elim area in order to strengthened his power base at Luonde. He was a feared warlord even the Venda king Makhado did not provoked him because he knew that Albasini possessed thousands of ammunition which he and his Tsonga followers will not hesitate to use at any time against anyone who provoke him.\n\nHowever, when Albasini departed Magashula's kraal in 1843, many of his Tsonga followers remained behind and continue to support kgoshi Magashula's struggles against invading Swazis. As more and more Tsonga people started to flood Pretoriuskop, Skukuza, and Numbi, the Swazi gradually withdrew their invading tactics due to casualties. The Swazis gave up their fight against kgoshi Magashula because they realized that they can never win the war, for the enemy was now to big to defeat, because the Tsonga people were giving kgoshi Magashula a lot of military support. Tsonga settlements of Manungukop, Pretoriuskop, Skukuza, Numbi, Satara and many more in the southern Kruger were forcibly removed when the colonial government created the Kruger national park between 1899 and 1902.\n\nToday, Hazyview is a home of the Tsonga people, who occupy the north-eastern part of this beautiful town along the banks of the Sabie River. To the south of Hazyview, the Swazi people call this their home. While to the north-western part of this town, the Mapulana people and their cultures are to be found. Sepulana, their language, one of the Northern Sotho language, this is what makes the Mapulana an interesting cultural group in Hazyview.\n\nWhite Africans also reside in Hazyview. With four cultural groupings in one town, Hazyview is a melting pot of diverse cultures in South Africa's lowveld region.\n\nThe Mapulana people are currently claiming the whole north-western part of the town until the town of Sabie, from Hazyview to Sabie. While the Tsonga people, the custodian of South Africa's big five game, are claiming the whole north-eastern part of Hazyview, in particular all the game reserves east of Hazyview and southern Kruger, such as Skukuza, Pretoriuskop, Satara, Protea Hotel Kruger Gate etc. While the Swazi people are claiming the whole southern part of the town.\n\nHazyview is 5 kilometers from Phabeni Gate which leads into the Kruger National Park. Hazyview is also a stop on the Panorama Route, a scenic road. Hazyview is situated 60\u00a0km from Mbombela.",

  "title": "Kirby Krackle",
  "text": "Kirby Krackle\n\nKirby Krackle (also known as Kirby Dots) is an artistic convention in superhero and science fiction comic books and similar illustrations, in which a field of black is used to represent negative space around unspecified kinds of energy. Kirby Krackles are typically used in illustrations of explosions, smoke, the blasts from ray guns, \"cosmic\" energy, and outer space phenomena.\n\nThe effect is named after Jack Kirby, the influential comic book artist who created this stylistic device. While the Kirby Krackle in its mature form first appeared in Kirby's work during 1965\u20131966 (in \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Thor\"), comics historian Harry Mendryk (of the Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center) has traced the earliest version of the stylistic device as far back as 1940 to Jack Kirby and Joe Simon's \"Blue Bolt\" #5. As Joe Simon was the inker on that comic, he may have been partially responsible for look of the proto-Kirby Krackle. Examples of a transitional form of the Kirby Krackle appear in two of Kirby's stories from the late 1950s: \"The Man Who Collected Planets\" from 1957 (pencils and inks by Kirby) and \"The Negative Man\" from 1959 (inks attributed to Marvin Stein). The effects were used during the transformation sequences in \"Ben 10\" (2005) and (2012)\n\nKirby Krackle is incorporated into the design of Disney California Adventure's Avengers Campus.\n\nPhilosophy professor and author Jeffrey J.

  "title": "Confederate Ireland",
  "text": "Confederate Ireland\n\nConfederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons.\n\nThe Confederate armies fought the Royalists, the English Parliamentarians, an army of Ulster Protestant settlers, and a Scottish Covenanter army that was sent to Ulster. These enemy forces controlled the Pale, parts of eastern and northern Ulster, and the region around Cork. The king authorised secret negotiations with the Confederates, resulting in a Confederate\u2013Royalist ceasefire in September 1643 and further negotiations. In 1644, a Confederate military expedition landed in Scotland to help Royalists there. The Confederates continued to fight the Parliamentarians in Ireland, and decisively defeated the Covenanter army in the Battle of Benburb. In 1647, the Confederates suffered a string of defeats by the Parliamentarians at Dungan's Hill, Cashel and Knockanuss. This prompted the Confederates to make an agreement with the Royalists. The agreement divided the Confederates, and this infighting hampered their preparations to resist a Parliamentarian invasion. In August 1649, a large English Parliamentarian army, led by Oliver Cromwell, invaded Ireland. By May 1652 it had defeated the Confederate\u2013Royalist alliance, although Confederate soldiers continued a guerrilla campaign for a further year.\n\nThe Irish Catholic Confederation was formed in the aftermath of the 1641 rebellion, both to control the popular uprising and to organise an Irish Catholic war effort against the remaining English and Scottish armies in Ireland. It was hoped that by doing this, the Irish Catholics could hold off an English or Scottish re-conquest of the country.\n\nThe initiative for the Confederation came from a Catholic bishop, Nicholas French, and a lawyer named Nicholas Plunkett. They put forth their proposals for a government to Irish Catholic nobles such as Viscount Gormanston, Viscount Mountgarret, Viscount Muskerry and the Baron of Navan. These men would commit their own armed forces to the Confederation and persuaded other rebels to join it. The declared aims of the Confederates were similar to those of Sir Phelim O'Neill, the leader of the early stages of the rebellion in Ulster, who issued the Proclamation of Dungannon in October 1641.\n\nOn 17 March 1642 these nobles signed the \"Catholic Remonstrance\" issued at Trim, County Meath that was addressed to King Charles I. On 22 March, at a synod in nearby Kells chaired by Hugh O'Reilly, Archbishop of Armagh, a majority of the Catholic bishops proclaimed that the rebellion was a just war.\n\nOn 10 May 1642, Ireland's Catholic clergy held a synod at Kilkenny. Present were the Archbishops of Armagh, Cashel and Tuam, eleven bishops or their representatives, and other dignitaries. They drafted the Confederate Oath of Association and called on all Catholics in Ireland to take the oath. Those who took the oath swore allegiance to Charles I and vowed to obey all orders and decrees made by the \"Supreme Council of the Confederate Catholics\". The rebels henceforth became known as Confederates. The synod re-affirmed that the rebellion was a \"just war\". It called for the creation of a council (made up of clergy and nobility) for each province, which would be overseen by a national council for the whole island. It vowed to punish misdeeds by Confederate soldiers and to excommunicate any Catholic who fights against the Confederation. The synod sent agents to France, Spain and Italy to gain support, gather funds and weapons, and recruit Irishmen serving in foreign armies. Lord Mountgarret was appointed president of the Confederate Supreme Council, and a General Assembly was fixed for October that year.\n\nThe first Confederate General Assembly was held in Kilkenny on 24 October 1642, where it set up a provisional government. The Assembly was a parliament in all but name. Present at the first Assembly were 14 Lords Temporal and 11 Lords Spiritual from the Parliament of Ireland, along with 226 commoners. The Confederate's constitution was written by a Galway lawyer named Patrick D'Arcy. The Assembly resolved that each county should have a council, overseen by a provincial council made up of two representatives from each county council. The Assembly agreed orders \"to be observed as the model of their government\".\n\nThe Assembly elected an executive known as the Supreme Council. The first Supreme Council was elected on or about 14 November. It consisted of 24 members, 12 of whom were to abide always in Kilkenny or wherever else they deemed fitting.\n\nThe members of the first Supreme Council were as follows:\nJames Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, representing the Crown, was the final member of the Supreme Council.\n\nThe Supreme Council would have power over all military generals, military officers and civil magistrates. Its first act was to name the generals who were to command Confederate forces: Owen Roe O'Neill was to command the Ulster forces, Thomas Preston the Leinster forces, Garret Barry the Munster forces and John Burke the Connacht forces. Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde was named head general, as they thought he would sooner or later join the Confederates. The Supreme Council issued an order to raise \u00a330,000 and a levy of 31,700 men in Leinster who were to be trained at once.\n\nThe Supreme Council also made its own seal, described as follows: \"'Twas circular, and in its centre was a large cross, the base of which rested on a flaming heart, while its apex was overlapped by the wings of a dove. On the left of the cross was the harp , and on the right the crown.\" The motto on the seal was \"Pro Deo, Rege, et Patria, Hiberni Unanimes\" (\"For God, King and Fatherland, Ireland is United\").\n\nA National Treasury, a mint for making coins, and a press for printing proclamations were set up in Kilkenny. This first General Assembly sat until 9 January 1643.\n\nHowever, the Confederate Catholic Association of Ireland never actually claimed to be an independent government, because (in the context of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms) they professed to be Royalists, loyal to Charles I. Since only the King could legally call a Parliament, the Confederate General Assembly never claimed to be a Parliament either, although it acted like one. In negotiations with the Royalists, the Confederates demanded that all concessions made to them would be ratified in a post war Parliament of Ireland, which would have resembled the Confederate General Assembly including some Protestant Royalists.\n\nThe Confederates' stated objective was to reach an agreement with the King. The ambitions were: full rights for Catholics in Ireland, toleration of the Catholic religion, and self-government for Ireland. Their campaign for religious equality in 1628\u201334 had been promised but then shelved by Charles until 1641.\n\nThe members of the Supreme Council were predominantly of Hiberno-Norman descent and were distrusted by many of the Gaelic Irish, who felt they were too moderate in their demands. The more radical Confederates pressed for a reversal of the plantations and the establishment of Catholicism as the state religion in Ireland.\n\nThe Confederates believed that their aspirations were best served by alliance with the royalist cause and therefore made supporting the King a central part of their strategy. This was because some English MPs and Scottish Covenanters had threatened before the war to invade Ireland and destroy the Catholic religion and Irish land-owning class, but the threat was never official policy. The King, by contrast, had repeatedly promised them some concessions. The difficulty for Charles was that he was horrified at the 1641 rebellion and had signed the Adventurers Act into law in 1642, which proposed confiscating all rebel held lands in Ireland. A new policy of refusing pardon to any Irish rebels had also been agreed in London and Dublin (issuing pardons had been a common method to end Irish conflicts in the previous century). Therefore, his forces remained hostile to the Confederates until 1643, when his military position in England started to weaken. Many of the Confederate gentry stood to lose their land under the Adventurers Act; it galvanised their efforts and they realised that it could only be repealed by taking a loyal stance.\nHowever, while the moderate Confederates were anxious to come to an agreement with Charles I and did not press for radical political and religious reforms, others wished to force the King to accept a self-governing Catholic Ireland before they came to terms with him. Failing that, they advocated an independent alliance with France or Spain.\n\nIn September 1643, the Confederates negotiated a \"cessation of arms\" (or ceasefire), with James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the senior general of the royalist army in Ireland. It was signed at Jigginstown, near Naas. This meant that hostilities ceased between the Confederates and Ormonde's royalist army based in Dublin. However, the English garrison in Cork (which was commanded by Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, a rare Gaelic Irish Protestant) objected to the ceasefire and mutinied, and he declared their allegiance to the English Long Parliament. The Scottish Covenanters had also landed an army in Ulster in 1642, which remained hostile to the Confederates and to the king \u2013 as did the Laggan Army of the Scottish settlers living in Ulster.\n\nThe Jacobite historian Thomas Carte mentioned the financial terms of the Cessation, whereby the Confederates undertook to pay Ormonde \u00a330,000 in stages up to May 1644, half in cash and half in live cattle.\n\nIn 1644 the Confederates sent around 1,500 men under Alasdair MacColla to Scotland to support the royalists there under James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Covenanters, sparking a Civil War \u2013 their only intervention on the Royalist side in the civil wars in Great Britain.\n\nThe Confederates received modest subsidies from the monarchies of France and Spain, who wanted to recruit troops in Ireland but their main continental support came from the Papacy. Pope Urban VIII sent Pierfrancesco Scarampi to liaise with and help the Confederates' Supreme Council in 1643. Pope Innocent X strongly supported Confederate Ireland, over the objections of Cardinal Mazarin and the Queen, Henrietta Maria, who had moved to Paris in 1644. Innocent received the Confederation's envoy in February 1645 and resolved to send a nuncio extraordinary to Ireland, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo, who embarked from La Rochelle with the Confederacy's secretary, Richard Bellings. He took with him a large quantity of arms and military supplies and a very large sum of money. These supplies meant that Rinuccini had a big influence on the Confederates' internal politics and he was backed by the more militant Confederates such as Owen Roe O'Neill. At Kilkenny Rinuccini was received with great honours, asserting that the object of his mission was to sustain the King, but above all to help the Catholic people of Ireland in securing the free and public exercise of the Catholic religion, and the restoration of the churches and church property, but not any former monastic property.\n\nThe Supreme Council put great hope in a secret treaty they had concluded with Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, under his new title of Earl of Glamorgan, on the King's behalf, which promised further concessions to Irish Catholics in the future. Being a very wealthy English Catholic royalist, Glamorgan was sent to Ireland in late June 1645 with secret orders from Charles to agree to the Confederates' demands in return for an Irish Catholic army that would fight for the King in England. The plan would be anathema to most English Protestants at the time. A copy of Glamorgan's secret orders was publicised by the Long Parliament, and to preserve his support in Protestant England the King had to deny his link and even proclaimed Glamorgan as a traitor. To deter the use of Confederate Irish soldiers in England the Long Parliament passed the Ordinance of no quarter to the Irish in October 1644.\n\nThe nuncio considered himself the virtual head of the Confederate Catholic party in Ireland. In 1646 the Supreme Council of the Confederates had come to an agreement with Ormonde, signed on 28 March 1646. Under its terms Catholics would be allowed to serve in public office and to found schools; there were also verbal promises of future concessions on religious toleration. There was an amnesty for acts committed in the Rebellion of 1641 and a guarantee against further seizure of Irish Catholic rebels' land by acts of attainder.\n\nHowever, there was no reversal of Poynings' Law, which meant that any legislation due to be presented to the Parliament of Ireland must first be approved by the English Privy Council, no reversal of the Protestant majority in the Irish House of Commons and no reversal of the main plantations, or colonisation, in Ulster and Munster. Moreover, regarding the religious articles of the treaty, all churches taken over by Catholics in the war would have to be returned to Protestant hands and the public practice of Catholicism was not guaranteed.\n\nIn return for the concessions that were made Irish troops would be sent to England to fight for the royalists in the English Civil War. However, the terms agreed were not acceptable to either the Catholic clergy, the Irish military commanders \u2013 notably Owen Roe O'Neill and Thomas Preston \u2013 or the majority of the General Assembly. Nor was the papal nuncio Rinuccini party to the treaty, which left untouched the objects of his mission; he had induced nine of the Irish bishops to sign a protest against any arrangement with Ormonde or the king that would not guarantee the maintenance of the Catholic religion.\n\nMany believed the Supreme Council were unreliable, since many of them were related to Ormonde or otherwise bound to him. Besides, it was pointed out that the English Civil War had already been decided in the English Parliament's favour and that sending Irish troops to the royalists would be a futile sacrifice. On the other hand, many felt after O'Neill's Ulster army defeated the Scots at the battle of Benburb in June 1646 that the Confederates were in a position to re-conquer all of Ireland. Furthermore, those who opposed the peace were backed, both spiritually and financially, by Rinuccini, who threatened to excommunicate the \"peace party\". The Supreme Council were arrested and the General Assembly voted to reject the deal.\n\nAfter the Confederates rejected the peace deal, Ormonde handed Dublin over to a parliamentarian army under Michael Jones. The Confederates now tried to eliminate the remaining parliamentarian outposts in Dublin and Cork, but in 1647 suffered a series of military disasters. First, Thomas Preston's Leinster army was destroyed by Jones's parliamentarians at the Battle of Dungan's Hill in County Meath. Then, less than three months later, the Confederates' Munster army met a similar fate at the hands of Inchiquin's parliamentarian forces at the battle of Knocknanauss.\n\nThese setbacks made most Confederates much more eager to come to reach an agreement with the royalists and negotiations were re-opened. The Supreme Council received generous terms from Charles I and Ormonde, including toleration of the Catholic religion, a commitment to repealing Poyning's Law (and therefore to Irish self-government), recognition of lands taken by Irish Catholics during the war, and a commitment to a partial reversal of the Plantation of Ulster. In addition, there was to be an Act of Oblivion, or amnesty for all acts committed during the 1641 rebellion and Confederate wars \u2013 in particular the killings of British Protestant settlers in 1641 \u2013 combined with no disbanding of the Confederate armies.\n\nHowever Charles granted these terms only out of desperation and later repudiated them. Under the terms of the agreement, the Confederation was to dissolve itself, place its troops under royalist commanders and accept English royalist troops. Inchiquin also defected from the Parliament and rejoined the royalists in Ireland.\n\nHowever, many of the Irish Catholics continued to reject a deal with the royalists. Owen Roe O'Neill refused to join the new royalist alliance and fought a brief internal civil war with the royalists and Confederates in the summer of 1648. So alienated was O'Neill by what he considered to be a betrayal of Catholic war aims that he tried to make a separate peace with the English Parliament and was for a short time effectively an ally of the English parliamentary armies in Ireland. This was disastrous for the wider aims of the Confederacy, as it coincided with the outbreak of the second civil war in England. The Papal Nuncio, Rinuccini, endeavoured to uphold Owen Roe O'Neill by excommunicating all who in May 1648 took part in the Inchiquin Truce with the Royalists; but he could not get the Irish Catholic Bishops to agree on the matter. On 23 February 1649, he embarked at Galway, in his own frigate, to return to Rome.\n\nIt is often argued that this split within the Confederate ranks represented a split between Gaelic Irish and Old English. It is suggested that a particular reason for this was that Gaelic Irish had lost much land and power since the English conquest of Ireland and hence had become radical in their demands. However, there were members of both ethnicities on each side. For example, Phelim O'Neill, the Gaelic Irish instigator of the Rebellion of 1641, sided with the moderates, whereas the predominantly Old English south Wexford area rejected the peace. The Catholic clergy were also split over the issue.\n\nThe real significance of the split was between those landed gentry who were prepared to compromise with the royalists as long as their lands and civil rights were guaranteed, and those, such as Owen Roe O'Neill, who wanted to completely overturn the English presence in Ireland. They wanted an independent, Catholic Ireland, with the English and Scottish settlers expelled permanently. Many of the militants were most concerned with recovering ancestral lands their families had lost in the plantations. After inconclusive skirmishing with the Confederates, Owen Roe O'Neill retreated to Ulster and did not rejoin his former comrades until Cromwell's invasion of 1649. This infighting fatally hampered the preparations of the Confederate-royalist alliance to repel the invasion of parliamentarian New Model Army.\n\nOliver Cromwell invaded Ireland in 1649 to crush the new alliance of Irish Confederates and royalists. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland was the bloodiest warfare that had ever occurred in the country and was accompanied by plague and famine. Kilkenny fell after a short siege in 1650. It ended in total defeat for the Irish Catholics and royalists. The pre-war Irish Catholic land-owning class was all but destroyed in this period, as were the institutions of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the senior members of the Confederation spent the Cromwellian period in exile in France, with the English Royalist Court. After the Restoration, those Confederates who had promoted alliance with the Royalists found themselves in favour and on average recovered about a third of their lands. However, those who remained in Ireland throughout the Interregnum generally had their land confiscated, with prisoners of war executed or transported to penal colonies.\n\nConfederate Ireland's style of parliament was similar to the landed oligarchy Parliament of Ireland established by the Normans in 1297, but it was not based on a democratic vote. Given their large notional power base, the Confederates ultimately failed to manage and reorganise Ireland so as to defend the interests of Irish Catholics. The Irish Confederate Wars and the ensuing Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649\u201353) caused massive loss of life and ended with the confiscation of almost all Irish Catholic owned land in the 1650s, though much was re-granted in the 1660s. The end of the period cemented the English colonisation of Ireland in the so-called Cromwellian Settlement.",

  "title": "Personal flotation device",
  "text": "Personal flotation device\n\nA personal flotation device (PFD; also referred to as a life jacket, life preserver, life belt, Mae West, life vest, life saver, cork jacket, buoyancy aid or flotation suit) is a flotation device in the form of a vest or suite that is donned and fastened to a user to prevent the wearer from drowning in a body of water. The device will keep the wearer afloat with his\/her head and mouth above the surface \u2013 he\/she does not have to swim or tread water in order to stay afloat and can even be unconscious.\n\nUnlike other flotation devices, a PFD is fastened to the user and does not need to be actively held onto; this prevents a wearer who is either in the water or falling into the water from losing her grip on the flotation and subsequently becoming immersed in the water leading to drowning. The fastening of the device also allows it to be comfortable when worn in the water and allows for wearer to swim or propel her\/himself with all limbs. For these reasons PFD's are the most common and widely used form of flotation device.\n\nPFDs are commonly worn on small watercraft or other locations where accidental entry into deep water may occur in order to provide immediate support for the wearer should they end up in the water. PFDs are also kept on large vessels for passengers to wear in an emergency in order to help them stay afloat should they be forced to enter the water or accidentally fall overboard during an evacuation. PFD's are commonly worn for swimming and\/or other activities that require an individual to be in the water. This is for reasons such as safety (to prevent the drowning of weak swimmers, swimmers in dangerous conditions or swimmers far from safety), to make swimming easier and less demanding, to allow someone who is unable to swim to safely enter water, or as assistance for activities such as water skiing.\n\nPFDs are available in different sizes to accommodate variations in body weight. Designs differ depending on wearing convenience, the activities and conditions they are designed to be used in and the level of protection the wearer needs. There are three main types of PFDs: life jackets, buoyancy aids and survival suits; PFDs are most often constructed out of foam pieces, with the exception of some life jackets which are inflated with air. Other highly specialized forms of PFDs include buoyancy compensators used for scuba diving, and submarine escape devices.\n\nThe oldest examples of primitive life jackets can be traced back to inflated bladders, animal skins, or hollow sealed gourds for support when crossing deep streams and rivers. Purpose-designed buoyant safety devices consisting of simple blocks of wood or cork were used by Norwegian seamen.\n\nIn a letter to the Naval Chronicle, dated February 1802, Abraham Bosquet proposed issuing Royal Navy Ships with \"strong canvas bags of dimensions, when filled with cork shavings, equal to about that of a bed bolster, coiled in manner like a collar, and sufficiently wide for the head and shoulders to pass through.\"\n\nIn 1804, a cork life jacket was available for sale in \"The Sporting Magazine\".\n\nPersonal flotation devices were not part of the equipment issued to naval sailors until the early 19th century, for example at the Napoleonic Battle of Trafalgar, although seamen who were press-ganged into naval service might have used such devices to jump ship and swim to freedom.\n\nIt was not until lifesaving services were formed that the personal safety of lifeboat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern life jacket is generally credited to the Inspector of Lifeboats at the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in the UK, Captain John Ross Ward (later Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy). He created a cork vest in 1854 to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.\n\nIn 1900, French electrical engineer, Gustave Trouv\u00e9, patented a battery-powered wearable lifejacket. It incorporated small, rubber-insulated maritime electric batteries not only to inflate the jacket, but also to power a light to transmit and receive SOS messages and to launch a distress flare.\nThe rigid cork material eventually came to be supplanted by pouches containing watertight cells filled with kapok, a vegetable material. These soft cells were much more flexible and comfortable to wear compared with devices using hard cork pieces. Kapok buoyancy was used in many navies fighting in World War II. Foam eventually supplanted kapok for 'inherently buoyant' (vs. inflated and therefore not inherently buoyant) flotation.\n\nThe University of Victoria pioneered research and development of the UVic Thermo Float PFD, which provides superior protection from immersion hypothermia by incorporating a neoprene rubber \"diaper\" that seals the user's upper thigh and groin region from contact with otherwise cold, flushing and debilitating water.\n\nDuring World War II, research to improve the design of life jackets was also conducted in the UK by Edgar Pask OBE, the first Professor of Anaesthesia at Newcastle University. His research involved self-administered anaesthesia as a means of simulating unconsciousness in freezing sea-water. Pask's work earned him the OBE and the description of \"the bravest man in the RAF never to have flown an aeroplane\".\n\nThe Mae West was a common nickname for the first inflatable life preserver, which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885\u20131974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated life preserver often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests as part of their flight gear. Air crew members whose lives were saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the Goldfish Club.\n\nDevices designed and approved by authorities for use by civilians (recreational boaters, sailors, canoeists, kayakers) differ from those designed for use by passengers and crew of aircraft (helicopters, airplanes) and of commercial vessels (tugboats, passenger ferries, cargo ships). Devices used by government and military (e.g. water police, coast guard, navy, marines) generally have features not found on civilian or commercial models, for example compatibility with other items worn, like a survival vest, bulletproof vest\/body armor, equipment harness, rappelling harness, or parachute harness, and the use of ballistic nylon cloth to protect pressurized canisters used for inflating the vest from injuring the wearer if struck by a round from a firearm. The ballistic cloth keeps the fragments from the canister from becoming shrapnel injurious to the user.\n\nLife jackets or life vests are mandatory on airplanes flying over water bodies, in which case they consist of a pair of air cells (bladders) that can be inflated by triggering the release of carbon dioxide gas from a canister\u2014one for each cell. Or the cells can be inflated \"orally\" that is by blowing into a flexible tube with a one-way valve to seal the air in the cell. Life jackets must also be supplied on commercial seafaring vessels, be accessible to all crew and passengers, and be donned in an emergency.\n\nFlotation devices are also found in near water-edges and at swimming pools. They may take the form of a simple vest, a jacket, a full-body suit (one piece coverall), or their variations suited for particular purposes. They are most commonly made of a tough synthetic fiber material encapsulating a source of buoyancy, such as foam or a chamber of air, and are often brightly colored yellow or orange to maximize visibility for rescuers. Some devices consist of a combination of both buoyancy foam and an air chamber. Retroreflective \"SOLAS\" tape is often sewn to the fabric used to construct life jackets and PFDs to facilitate a person being spotted in darkness when a search light is shone towards the wearer.\nIn the US, federal regulations require all persons under the age of 13 to wear a life jacket (PFD) when in a watercraft under 12 meters long. State regulations may raise or lower this number and must be followed when in that state's jurisdiction.\n\nThe simplest and least buoyant type of PFD comes in the form of nylon-lined foam vests, used predominantly in water sports such as kayaking, canoeing and dinghy sailing.\n\nBuoyancy aids are designed to allow freedom of movement while providing a user with the necessary buoyancy. They are also designed for minimal maintenance and as they are only constructed from foam and can be mass-produced inexpensively, making them one of the most common forms of PFDs.\n\nSome buoyancy aids also come designed especially for children and youth. These vests may include one or two understraps to be worn between the legs of the wearer and also a headrest flap. The understraps are designed to keep the vest from riding up when worn in the water and restrict the wearer from slipping out of the life vest. These straps are adjustable and are included on many different life vests designed to be worn by everyone from infants to adults.\nThe headrest flap is designed to help support the head and keep it out of the water. A grab handle is attached to the headrest to be used if needed to rescue or lift someone out of the water.\n\nBuoyancy aids are rated by the amount of buoyancy they provide in Newtons - the minimum rating to be considered suitable as an adult life-jacket for offshore use is .\n\nLife jackets for outfitting large commercial transport ventures in potentially dangerous waters, such as coastal cruises, offshore passages, and overwater air flights, consisting of either a single air chamber or a pair of (twin or double) sealed air chambers constructed of coated nylon (sometimes with a protective outer encasing of heavier, tougher material such as vinyl), joined together, and buckled with a side release buckle. For use aboard ships they may be constructed of foam. Twin air chambers provide for redundancy in the event of one of the air chambers leaking or failing to \"fire\", for example if the thin air cell fabric is sliced open by sharp metal fragments during emergency evacuation and egress. Most life jackets for leisure use are of the single air chamber type.\n\nAircraft devices for crew and passengers are always inflatable since it may be necessary to swim down and away from a ditched or submerged aircraft and inflated or foam filled devices would significantly impede a person from swimming downward in order to escape a vehicle cabin. Upon surfacing, the person then inflates the device, orally or by triggering the gas canister release mechanism. Most commercial passenger life jackets are fitted with a plastic whistle for attracting attention. It has a light which is activated when in contact with water.\n\nQuality life jackets always provide more buoyancy than offered by the buoyancy aids alone. The positioning of the buoyancy on the wearer's torso is such that a righting moment (rotational force) results that will eventually turn most persons who are floating face down in the water (for example, because they are unconscious) into a face up orientation with their bodies inclined backward, unlike more simply designed common foam buoyancy vests.\n\nToday these air chamber vests are commonly referred to as 'inflatable life jackets or vests' and are available not only for commercial applications but also for those engaged in recreational boating, fishing, sailing, kayaking and canoeing. They are available in a variety of styles and are generally more comfortable and less bulky than traditional foam vests.\n\nThe air chambers are always located over the breast, across the shoulders and encircle the back of the head. They may be inflated by either self-contained carbon dioxide cartridges activated by pulling a cord, or blow tubes with a one-way valve for inflation by exhalation. Some inflatable life jackets also react with salt or fresh water, which causes them to self-inflate. The latest generation of self-triggering inflation devices responds to water pressure when submerged and incorporates an actuator known as a 'hydrostatic release'. All automatic life-jackets can be fired manually if required. Regardless of whether manually or automatically triggered, a pin punctures the cartridge\/canister and the CO gas escapes into the sealed air chamber.\n\nHowever, there is a chance that these water pressure activated inflation devices do not inflate the life jacket if a person is wearing waterproof clothing and falls into the water face-down. In these cases the buoyancy of the clothing holds a person on the water surface, which prevents the hydrostatic release. As a result, a person can drown although wearing a fully functional life jacket. In addition there are some circumstances in which the use of self-triggering devices can result in the wearer becoming trapped underwater. For example, the coxswain of a bowloader rowing shell risks being unable to escape should the craft capsize.\n\nTo be on the safe side, a pill-activated inflation device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup\/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.\n\nDrifting in open seas and international waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often attached to a vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406\u00a0MHz frequency), signal mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or light signal flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.\n\nAccessories such as leg straps can be utilized to keep the inflated chambers in position for floating in a stable attitude, and splash or face shields constructed of clear see-through vinyl covers the head and face to prevent water from waves from inundating the face and entering the airway through the nose or mouth.\n\nSome formats of PFDs are designed for long term immersion in cold water in that they provide insulation as well as buoyancy. While a wetsuit of neoprene rubber or a diver's drysuit provides a degree of flotation, in most maritime countries they are not formally considered by regulatory agencies as approved lifesaving devices or as PFDs.\n\nIt is possible for an incapacitated person in the water to float face-down while wearing only a wet suit or a dry suit since they are not designed to serve as lifesaving devices in the normal understanding of that term.\n\nThe Mark 10 Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment (SEIE) suit is intended to allow submariners to escape from much deeper depths than currently possible with the Steinke hood. Some United States Navy submarines already have the system, with an ambitious installation and training schedule in place for the remainder of the fleet.\n\nBecause it is a full-body suit, the Mark 10 provides thermal protection once the wearer reaches the surface, and the Royal Navy has successfully tested it at depths.\n\nScuba divers commonly wear a buoyancy compensator, which has an inflatable gas chamber. The amount of gas can be increased or decreased to enable the diver to ascend, descend or maintain neutral buoyancy at a given water depth and to provide positive buoyancy in an emergency to bring him to the surface or keep him at the surface.\n\nSpecialized life jackets include shorter-profile vests commonly used for kayaking (especially playboating), and high-buoyant types for river outfitters and other whitewater professionals. PFDs which include harnesses for tethered rescue work ('live-bait rescue') and pockets or daisy-chains (a series of loops created by sewing flat nylon webbing at regular intervals for the attachment of rescue gear) are made for swiftwater rescue technicians.\n\nPersonal flotation devices have been developed for dogs and other pets.\n\nWhile the USCG does not certify personal flotation devices for animals, many manufacturers produce life jackets for dogs and cats. Dogs and cats have been known to die from drowning, either because they do not know how to swim, or because they tire out from overexposure or old age, or have a medical complication such as a seizure, or become unconscious.\n\nMost life jackets on the market are designed with foam that wraps around the animal's torso and neck. They provide a basic amount of buoyancy for a dog, but may not provide enough support for the head. They are not ideal for use with heavy dogs. However, they often incorporate a grab handle, which may help to hoist the dog back into the boat.\n\nAlthough most pet life jackets are passive devices, there is at least one automatically inflated life jacket available for pets (made by Critter's Inflatable, LLC). An automatic flotation device is generally more expensive than a foam life jacket, but, like automatic PFDs designed for humans, they are less bulky to wear when not inflated, and when inflated may provide more buoyancy than foam devices. Automatic pet flotation devices are popular in the bulldog community, and also for water therapy where extra support may be needed under the head.",

  "text": "Kaapmuiden\n\nKaapmuiden \"(Cape Mouth)\" is a small farming town situated at the confluence of the Kaap and Crocodile Rivers in Mpumalanga, South Africa. The town lies just off the N4 national highway and is marked by a large abandoned silo visible from the road. The silo has since been repainted to add to tourism appeal. The farms in the region produce sugarcane, subtropical fruit and vegetables. The town began as a junction on the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM)'s Pretoria - Delagoa Bay railway line.\n\nRecently the town underwent some development due to the Sasol pipeline and construction and upgrading of the national highway. The Nkomazi Tollgate has subsequently been built on the outskirts of the town.",
